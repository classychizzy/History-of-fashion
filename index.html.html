    <p> <strong> History of fashion </strong> design refers specifically
        to the development of the purpose and intention behind garments,
        shoes and accessories,and their design and construction.
        The modern industry, based around firms or
        <a href="#"> fashion houses </a> run by individual designers,
        started in the 19th century with
        <a href="#"> Charles Frederick Worth </a> who, beginning in 1858,
        was the first designer to have his label sewn into the garments
        he created.[1]

        Fashion started when humans began wearing clothes.
        These clothes were typically made from plants, animal skins and
        bone. Before the mid-19th century the division between haute couture
        and ready-to-wear did not really exist.
        But the most basic pieces of female clothing were made-to-measure
        by dressmakers and seamstresses dealing directly with the client.
        Most often, clothing was patterned, sewn and tailored in the
        household. When storefronts appeared selling ready-to-wear clothing,
        this need was removed from the domestic workload.
